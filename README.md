# RGB-Controller
Repository for our selfmade RGB Controller.

We want to use different methods to use the Controller, eg. Blynk or MQTT.
Blynk is done already, but we are still working on MQTT.

Our project is for personal use only, you are not allowed to sell it in any kind.
If you want to build it yourself, check the [Hardware](/Hardware/) directory, all the parts are listed and you can upload the zip folder to order a PCB. 
We purchased the ESP8266 and the 12V PSU via Aliexpress. (The ESP usually has some headers included)
We used https://jlcpcb.com/ for the PCB and https://lcsc.com/ for the parts.

We used code of these repositories:
- https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager
- https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson
- https://github.com/jenscski/DoubleResetDetect
- https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
- https://blynk.io/

#theoretisch genial, praktisch egal
